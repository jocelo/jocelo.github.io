  <p>Welcome to this article where we will briefly discuss about one of the most used data structures when you are
    working on algorithms or solving optimization problems: such data structures is called a <b>queue</b>.</p>
  <p>You will want to read this article top to bottom, but in case you are really excited to see the code or the bigO
    analysis you can jump to such section using the index below:</p>

  <h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
  <p>The queue is a data structure, even more specific, is an abstract data type that implements the <u>FIFO</u>
    principle.</p>
  <p>FIFO stands for <i>First Input First Output</i>; in other words, <b>the first element that is inserted is the first
      element that gets out.</b></p>
  <p>A quick analogy that helps with understanding this concept is: Imagine the line of people outside the movie
    theater... The first person that got into the line is the first person that gets inside the theater. Given
    that everybody is respectful.</p>
  <p>Basic operations that you can perform on a queue are pretty similar as those you can do on a stack: <u>insert</u>
    of
    a new element/data and the <u>retrieve</u> of an element/data. These two operations are <i>usually</i> called <span
      class="inline-code">push</span> and <span class="inline-code">shift</span> respectively.</p>
  <p>We said usually, because they might be called different in another programming language, but the idea
    is the same.
  </p>
  <p>To implement this data type, as usual, it depends on the programming language of our choice, and it must likely
    that
    you will have these operations already part of the methods available to from the base code, so you just
    have to learn how to use them. These methods are part of the <span class="inline-code">array</span> object (or a
    list on python).</p>
  <p>The operations you perform on a queue are in the different <u>ends</u> of the queue: retrieving is performed at
    <u>the beginning of the queue</u> and insertion is made at <u>the bottom of the queue</u>.
  </p>

  <p>Next section we will see some code, and review the differences between programming languages.</p>

  <h2 id="bigo">Complexity analysis (big O)</h2>
  <p>The queue is an abstract data type with tons of uses in coding. On it's basic implementation, the complexity for
    <b>read</b> and <b>write</b>
    is of linear time O(n); where <span class="inline-code">n</span> is the size of the queue. We get this time
    complexity because whenever we
    insert or retrieve an element from the queue, we neeed to shift all the remainder elements from the list. This is,
    we need to shift all elements
    to the right when inserting a new element, and shift all elements to the left, when retrieving an element.
  </p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> The term <i>read</i> used above, is used in context of the <span class="inline-code">shift</span>
    operation.
    This usage of the term <i>read</i> must not be confused with other read operations executed in the queue ( <span
      class="inline-code">peek</span> is the most
    common term for actually reading the top of the queue... just read, not extracting a value ).
    Speaking of which, the <span class="inline-code">peek</span> operation has a constant time complexity O(1) because
    we are only <u>reading</u> the element,
    we do not have to shift the position of any elements.
    There's another way to work with queues that help us reduce the time complexity, this discussion was left out of
    this article to reduce the complexity,
    however there are some programing languages that have some modules/objects that are part of the code base and let us
    work with queues in a more
    efficient way.
    One example is <fa-icon [icon]="faPython"></fa-icon> python (python2.7 and above). Python has an object called <span
      class="inline-code">deque</span> (double-ended queue)
    that is part of the collections module; this one offers a constant time complexity O(1) in insert and retrieve
    operations. You can read more about this object
    in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/collections.html#collections.deque" target="_blank">official
      documentation</a>.

  <h2 id="conclusion">Wrapping up</h2>
  <p>Thanks for reading this article!</p>
  <p>The queue ( and her relative <a [routerLink]="['/blog/','que-es-una-pila']">the stack</a> ) is an abstract data
    type
    highly used in optimization problems and when solving algorithms. <i>In general</i> is pretty simple to implement
    and the <span class="inline-code">array</span> data type (or list on python) already have the <span
      class="inline-code">push</span>
    and <span class="inline-code">shift</span> methods we need to work with the list as a queue.
  </p>
  <p>As seen before, some programming languages allow us to create an object that is already levering the functionality
    of a queue and
    provide us with a more optimal way of working with such abstract data type.
  </p>
  <p>Or even... you can implement a queue on your own! It's a fun project that will help in your understanding of this
    and other
    data structures and it will also help you understand the importance of code optimization.</p>
  <p>It's a wrap ladies and gents! Now you have under your belt the basic knowledge about this data structure/abstract
    data type. Remember about it next time you need to work with arrays. It might help you to solve some of your
    problems.</p>
